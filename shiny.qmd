# Interactive: Shiny apps {#sec-shiny}

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = T, warning = F, message = F)

if (!require(librarian)){
  install.packages("librarian")
  library(librarian)
}
shelf(
  htmltools, fontawesome)
  #mitchelloharawild/icons)
```

## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered .objectives}

Use the Shiny framework to develop online ***interactive*** applications accepting user input to render outputs from arbitrary R functions. Server requirements differentiating Shiny apps from simpler Quarto docs will be reviewed.

## Install `shiny` and other R packages

Ensure you have the `librarian` R package installed. Look in RStudio's Packages pane and Install if not found when searching for "librarian". This allows us to use the helper function [`librarian::shelf()`](https://github.com/DesiQuintans/librarian#readme) to load the libraries and install if needed:

```{r}
librarian::shelf(
  dplyr, ggplot2, leaflet, plotly, 
  tbep-tech/tbeptools,
  shiny, shinydashboard, tidyr)
```

Note that the `tbeptools` R package is installed from source on Github given the 'owner/repository' naming convention, so `tbep-tech/tbeptools` has source code at [github.com/tbep-tech/tbeptools](https://github.com/tbep-tech/tbeptools).

Later we'll use the simpler base function `library()` to load the libraries in the Shiny app since when publishing to [ShinyApps.io](https://ShinyApps.io) dependent libraries are automatically installed based on using `library()` (and not `librarian::shelf()`).

If you did not already have the `shiny` package installed, you should restart RStudio to use additional menu items for the next step.

## Create your first Shiny app

Let's create a simple Shiny app starting with the provided default in RStudio by going to the menu **File** -\> **New File** -\> **Shiny Web App**... and name it ***app-faithful*** (after [`faithful`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/faithful), the Old Faithful geyser eruption frequency dataset used in this default example):

![](figs/shiny/new-shiny_app-faithful.png){width="400"}

For now, let's go with the default **Single File** option that puts the entire application in `app.R` rather than splitting it in two (`ui.R`/`server.R`). You should see the following contents in the new file `app.R`:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show Code: `app.R`"
#| eval: false

#
# This is a Shiny web application. You can run the application by clicking
# the 'Run App' button above.
#
# Find out more about building applications with Shiny here:
#
#    http://shiny.rstudio.com/
#

library(shiny)

# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
ui <- fluidPage(

    # Application title
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),

    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput("bins",
                        "Number of bins:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 50,
                        value = 30)
        ),

        # Show a plot of the generated distribution
        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot")
        )
    )
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {

    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
        # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
        x    <- faithful[, 2]
        bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

        # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
    })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

### Run App

Let's next **Run App**. Note that you can change the options by clicking on the down triangle next to the button, such as running the app in your default web browser (***Run External***), a pop-up window or in RStudio's Viewer Pane.

![](figs/shiny/shiny-run-app-options.png){width="200"}

This is equivalent to sourcing the `app.R` file in the R console, including the last line which launches the application after defining the user interface (`ui`) and server functions (`server`):

``` r
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Now you can change the values in the slider on the left to change the "Number of bins" (`input$bins`) and see the updated plot (`output$distPlot`):

![](figs/shiny/faithful-app.png){width="600"}

### Understanding reactivity

In Shiny parlance, the histogram plot is ***reactive*** to the slider (see [Reactivity](./intro.html#reactivity)). Normally when creating web apps, this type of "reactivity" is quite complicated to code, but here by simply using `input$bins` in the plotting function for the `output$distPlot`, Shiny registers that this plot needs to be updated when the user changes the `input$bins` value. Let's breakdown the sequence of operations to ensure we understand **reactivity**:

1.  User changes the slider value (e.g., moves from the default value of 30 to max of 50):\
    ![](./figs/shiny/faithful_slide-bins.png){width="200"} <!--300px-->\
    This slider was created with the following code:

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    #| class-source: "numberLines"
    #| source-line-numbers: "2"

    sliderInput(
      "bins",
      "Number of bins:", min = 1, max = 50, value = 30)
    ```

    Note that the first argument of `sliderInput()` (see [`?sliderInput()`](https://shiny.posit.co/r/reference/shiny/latest/sliderinput)) is `inputID`, which is the name of the input variable to be used in the server function. In this case, the `inputID` is `"bins"` and the value of the slider is then accessed in the server function with `input$bins`. In summary:\
    `sliderInput("bins",...)` (in ui.R) becomes → `input$bins` (in server.R)

2.  Shiny registers that the `input$bins` value has changed and re-runs any functions in server.R that use this value, which in this case is `output$distPlot` defined by:

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    #| class-source: "numberLines"
    #| source-line-numbers: "4"

    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
      # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
      x    <- faithful[, 2]
      bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

      # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
      hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
    })
    ```

3.  The updated `output$distPlot` from server.R is refreshed in the layout of ui.R by `plotOutput()` since the first argument of this function is `outputID` which has the value `"distPlot"`:

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    #| class-source: "numberLines"
    #| source-line-numbers: "3"
      
    # Show a plot of the generated distribution
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("distPlot")
    )
    ```

    ![](./figs/shiny/faithful_distplot.png){width="400"} <!--571px-->

### Run in showcase mode

This default example along with other are made available in the shiny package's installed folder:

```{r}
# get path to "examples" under your installation of the Shiny R package
dir_examples  <- system.file("examples", package="shiny")

# get all directories listed there
dirs_examples <- list.dirs(dir_examples, recursive = F)

# show the folder name only, not the rest of the path preceding (ie dirname())
basename(dirs_examples)
```

Another way to launch a shiny app is using `runApp()` on a directory, like...

```{r}
# set directory to 01_hello app, aka the simplest default faithful app
dir_app <- file.path(dir_examples, "01_hello")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false

# run the app
shiny::runApp(dir_app)
```

Note that this example runs a similar Old Faithful app in a different location with an extra display on the right side highlighting the code that executes as you interact with the user interface.

### `r fa('hat-wizard')` Exercise: play with `display.mode`

Lookup help for the argument `display.mode` in the runApp() function (enter `?runApp` in R Console).

1.  What is the default `display.mode` for the app with the path `dir_app`?

2.  How is that defined?

3.  What's an alternative `display.mode` value to apply?

4.  Change the `display.mode` in your `app-faithful/app.R` by modifying arguments in the last line of `shinyApp()`.

5.  Run the other examples.

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" collapse="true"}

#### `r fa('wand-magic-sparkles')` Answers

1.  The default mode is `"showcase"`, which shows you the code and highlights in yellow the code that gets executed as the user interacts with the inputs.

2.  This is defined by the `DESCRIPTION` file in the same folder:

    ```{r}
    file.path(dir_app, "DESCRIPTION") |> readLines()
    ```

1.  The other mode is `"normal"`:

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    shiny::runApp(dir_app, display.mode = "normal")
    ```

1.  In the last line of `app-faithful/app.R` you would insert the extra argument `options = list(display.mode = "showcase")`:

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server, options = list(display.mode = "showcase"))
    ```

1.  In the last line of `app-faithful/app.R` you would insert the extra argument `options = list(display.mode = "showcase")`:

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
### `r fa('hat-wizard')` Exercise: add an input

Check out the available input widgets in the [Shiny - Widget Gallery](https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/widgets/widget-gallery/).

1.  Add any of the input widgets into the ui.R section of your `app-faithful/app.R`.

    Look at the help for the various `*Input()` functions and try out different argument values.

    The inputs do not have to be related at all to the `faithful` dataset. For choices, you can use a numeric vector like `1:10` or a character vector like `LETTERS[1:10]`.

2.  Display the value of the selection in the input widget with a `verbatimTextOutput()` added to the ui.R section and `renderPrint()` in the server.R section.

3.  Look at the app with the additional argument to `shinyApp()` of `options = list(display.mode = "showcase")` and see how the different server functions get highlighted as you interact with the different inputs.

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" collapse="true"}

#### `r fa('wand-magic-sparkles')` Answers

Here's the full app using `selectInput()` to select a letter and display it in the main panel:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show Code: `app.R`"
#| eval: false

library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(

  titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),

  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      sliderInput(
        "bins",
        "Number of bins:",
        min = 1, max = 50, value = 30),

      # add letter input
      selectInput(
        "sel_lttr",
        "Select letter:",
        choices = LETTERS[1:5]) ),

    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("distPlot"),

      # add letter output
      verbatimTextOutput("txt_lttr") ) )
)

server <- function(input, output) {

  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    x    <- faithful[, 2]
    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

    hist(
      x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white',
      xlab = 'Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)',
      main = 'Histogram of waiting times')
  })

  # render letter input to output
  output$txt_lttr <- renderPrint({ input$sel_lttr })
}

# run app in showcase mode
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server, options = list(display.mode = "showcase"))
```

Let's explicitly discuss each added bit of code:

1.  First, add the `selectInput()` into the ui.R section:

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
      
    # add letter input
    selectInput(
      "sel_lttr",
      "Select letter:",
      choices = LETTERS[1:5])
    ```

    Be sure your parenthesis are all closed and you have a comma in between elements sharing a common parent (e.g., `,` in between `sliderInput()` and `selectInput()` sharing parent of `sidebarPanel()`).

2.  Second, add the `verbatimTextOutput()` into the ui.R section as a place to display the value of the new widget:

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
      
    # add letter output
    verbatimTextOutput("txt_lttr")
    ```

3.  Last to show the value of the selected widget, add `renderPrint()` into the server.R section:

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
      
    # render letter input to output
    output$txt_lttr <- renderPrint({ input$sel_lttr })
    ```

4.  Finally, to show in showcase mode, add the extra argument to `shinyApp()`:

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false

    # run app in showcase mode
    shinyApp(
      ui = ui, server = server, 
      options = list(display.mode = "showcase"))
    ```

    Notice how only the function that gets updated ([highlighted]{style="background-color: #ffffb3;"}) is based on the changed \`input\$\*\`.\

### Tip: enable Rainbow Parentheses in RStudio

The more you develop Shiny apps, the more you'll appreciate [Rainbow Parentheses in RStudio](https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-1-4-preview-rainbow-parentheses/). This feature is disabled by default. To enable: visit the menu Tools \> Global Options, select Code -\> Display, and check the box next to Rainbow Parentheses.

## Create a complex Shiny app

In this next more complicated app we'll create an interactive time series plot and map. Users can select a station from a drop-down menu and see the time series for any of the available indicators from another drop-down selection. The map will show the location of the selected station.

![Complex app to create using water quality data from Tampa Bay, FL.](figs/shiny/app-wq.png)

You might notice the extra four dashes at the end of some of the comments in the code. Adding comments like these allows you to easily navigate to that section of code from the lower-left of the Source pane in RStudio:

![When comments end with four or more dashes `----` in the code, RStudio includes it as a menu item in the lower left of the Source pane to quickly jump to that section in the code. In this case menus are used to indicate content in `app.R` that might otherwise be split into seperate files: `global.R`, `ui.R` and `server.R`. Then an asterisk prefix `*` is used to bullet key sections within.](./figs/shiny/app-wq_headers.png){width="201px"}

In this extended tutorial, we will delve deeper into reactivity, data wrangling with `dplyr`, and the advantages of using R libraries that wrap JavaScript functionality. We'll start from the default Shiny application using the Old Faithful Geyser data and transform it into a more complex application.

### Prepare data

First, let's prepare the water quality data for our app from the Tampa Bay Estuary Program R package [tbeptools](https://tbep-tech.github.io/tbeptools/index.html) that we'll install if it's not already installed on your computer.

```{r}
if (!"tbeptools" %in% rownames(installed.packages()))
  install.packages(
    "tbeptools",
    repos = c(
      tbeptech = "https://tbep-tech.r-universe.dev",
      CRAN     = "https://cloud.r-project.org") )
library(tbeptools)

epcdata
```

The dataset `epcdata` (`?epcdata` for details) is "lazily loaded" as part of the `tbeptools` R package, available once the package is loaded with `library(tbeptools)`, similar to how `faithful` (`?faithful` for details) is automatically available from the base R package `datasets`.

### `r fa('hat-wizard')` Exercise: _**Tidy**_ data concepts

How should we prepare `epcdata` data to be tidy?

1.  What are the 3 goals of **tidy data**, per [tidyr.tidyverse.org](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org)?

2.  Let's assume we want three indicators: Total Nitrogen (mg/L) (`tn`), Chlorophyll-a (ug/L) (`chla`), and Secchi depth (m) (`sd_m`). Based on tidy principles, we want each row to capture a unique "observation" and any co-varying "variables" (such as location and time). So, do we need to pivot ***longer*** (`?tidyr::pivot_longer`) or ***wider*** (`?tidyr::pivot_longer`) to get each row as its own observation?

::: {.callout-tip icon="false" collapse="true"}

#### `r fa('wand-magic-sparkles')` Answers

1.  The 3 goals of **tidy data** are:
    1.  Every ***column*** is a variable.
    2.  Every ***row*** is an observation.
    3.  Every ***cell*** is a single value.
2.  The `epcdata` is currently in ***wide*** format, with each variable as its own column. We want to pivot it ***longer*** so that each row is an observation of a single indicator.
:::
:::

The `dplyr` package is the 'swiss army knife' (or 'plyers') for data wrangling, along with its close cousin `tidyr`. Let's look at some basic operations: filtering, selecting, and pivoting. Be sure to reference [Posit Cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/) like: [Data tidying with tidyr :: Cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/tidyr.html) and [Data transformation with dplyr :: Cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-transformation.html).

1.  **Filter**\
    ![](./figs/shiny/dplyr_filter.png){width=100}\
    Reduce ***rows*** based on condition(s) that evaluate logically (i.e. True or False)

    ``` r
    d |> 
      dplyr::filter(station == 8)
    ```

2.  **Select**\
    ![](./figs/shiny/dplyr_select.png){width=100}\
    Reduce ***columns*** to only those specified

    ``` r
    d |> 
      dplyr::select(
        station = epchc_station, 
        SampleTime,
        lon     = Longitude,
        lat     = Latitude)
    ```

3.  **Pivot**\
    ![](./figs/shiny/tidyr_pivot-longer.png){width=150}\
    Transform the data from wide _**to long**_ format, or vice versa

    ``` r
    d |> 
      tidyr::pivot_longer(
        names_to  = "var", 
        values_to = "val")
    ```

Applying the above concepts, we get:

```{r}
# * load libraries ----
library(dplyr)
library(tbeptools)
library(tidyr)

# * prep data ----
d <- epcdata |>
  select(
    station                 = epchc_station,
    SampleTime,
    lat                     = Latitude,
    lon                     = Longitude,
    `Total Nitrogen (mg/L)` = tn,
    `Chlorophyll-a (ug/L)`  = chla,
    `Secchi depth (m)`      = sd_m) |>
  pivot_longer(
    names_to  = "indicator",
    values_to = "value",
    `Total Nitrogen (mg/L)`:`Secchi depth (m)`)
d
```

We additionally need to prepare data for the following elements:

1.  **Stations**\
    List of unique station numbers for selecting from a drop-down menu.
2.  **Indicators**\
    List of unique indicators for selecting from a drop-down menu.
3.  **Locations**\
    List of unique station locations (i.e. stations with lat/lon coordinates) to display on the map.

```{r}
# * data for select ----
stations   <- unique(d$station)
indicators <- unique(d$indicator)
locations  <- d |>
  select(station, lon, lat) |>
  unique()

stations
indicators
locations
```

### Add User Interface

Let's add dropdown menus for station and indicator selection and placeholders for `plotly` and `leaflet` outputs. These outputs are **htmlwidgets** you learned about in the morning (see [Quarto using htmlwidgets](https://tbep-tech.github.io/shiny-workshop/quarto.html#quarto-using-htmlwidgets)), except we will be updating them *interactively* based on user input.

``` r
#  ui.R ----
ui <- fluidPage(

  # * layout ----
  wellPanel(
    h2("Water Quality"),
    
    # * input widgets ----
    selectInput("sel_sta", "Station",   choices = stations),
    selectInput("sel_ind", "Indicator", choices = indicators),
    
    # * output htmlwidgets ----
    plotlyOutput("tsplot"),
    leafletOutput("map") )
)
```

#### Layout

Notice that `shiny::fluidPage()` and `shiny::wellPanel()` are used to setup the layout of the app. For more details, check out [Shiny - Application layout guide](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/build/layout-guide/). And for even more advanced layout options, checkout [shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard) and [bslib](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/) R packages.

#### Htmlwidget outputs

Notice that [`plotly::plotlyOutput()`]() and [`leaflet::leafletOutput()`]() are used to layout the **htmlwidgets** you learned about in the morning (see [Quarto using htmlwidgets](https://tbep-tech.github.io/shiny-workshop/quarto.html#quarto-using-htmlwidgets)), except we will be updating them *interactively* based on user input with server-side functions.

### Add Server functions

The htmlwidget R packages made for Shiny generally have two functions: 1) an `*Output` to place in the layout (ui.R); and 2) a `render*` function amongst the back-side functions (server.R) based on user inputs:

-   general form: `render*` (server.R) -\> `*Output` (ui.R)
-   `plotly`: `renderPlotly()` -\> `plotlyOutput()`
-   `leaflet`: `leafletOutput()` -\> `renderLeaflet()`

#### Render time series plot

Let's add a `renderPlotly()` function to update the time series plot based on user inputs. The `renderPlotly()` function takes a [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) interactive plot object. We can use the `plotly::ggplotly()` function to take a static `ggplot2` plot object and make it an interactive plotly object. Using [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) allows us to take advantage of the Grammar of Graphics principles to render plots using a layered approach (see [cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization.pdf), [summary](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-grammar-of-graphics-for-effective-visualization-of-multi-dimensional-1f92b4ed4149) or [book](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448/ref=as_li_ss_tl)).

The `get_data()` function allows us to generate a data frame reactive to user inputs and available for use across multiple server-side functions (although here we only use one). For more, see [Shiny - Use reactive expressions](https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson6/).

``` r
#  server.R ----
server <- function(input, output, session) {

  # * get_data(): reactive to inputs ----
  get_data <- reactive({
    d |>
      filter(
        station   == input$sel_sta,
        indicator == input$sel_ind)
  })

  # * tsplot: time series plot ----
  output$tsplot <- renderPlotly({
    g <- ggplot(
      get_data(),
      aes(
        x = SampleTime,
        y = value) ) +
      geom_line() +
      labs(y = input$sel_ind)
    ggplotly(g)
  })
}
```

#### Render map

Let's add a `renderLeaflet()` function to update the map based on user inputs. The `renderLeaflet()` function takes a [`leaflet`](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) interactive map object. We can use the `leaflet::addLabelOnlyMarkers` function to add station labels. And to highlight the selected station we can use `leaflet::addCircles()`.

``` r
  # * map ----
  output$map <- renderLeaflet({

    # filter locations by station
    locs_sta <- locations |>
      filter(
        station == input$sel_sta)

    # create map
    leaflet(locations) |>
      addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) |>
      # add all stations
      addLabelOnlyMarkers(
        lat          = ~lat,
        lng          = ~lon,
        label        = ~as.character(station),
        labelOptions = labelOptions(
          noHide   = T,
          textOnly = T) ) |>
      # add selected station
      addCircles(
        data   = locs_sta,
        lng    = ~lon,
        lat    = ~lat,
        color  = "red",
        weight = 20)
  })
```

### `r fa('hat-wizard')` Exercise: Render table

Use the htmlwidget `DT::datatable()` to add an interactive table to the app. The `DT::datatable()` function takes a data frame object. We can use the `get_data()` function to generate a data frame reactive to user inputs.

## Publish App

Of the options to [Share your Shiny apps](https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson7/), the easiest is using [ShinyApps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/), which makes a publicly accessible web page for your app for up to 5 apps for free (see [Pricing](https://www.shinyapps.io/#pricing-anchor) for details). Visit [Shiny - Getting started with shinyapps.io](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/share/shinyapps/) to run through the following sequence:

1.  Install the `rsconnect` R package.
2.  Create an account at [ShinyApps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/).
3.  Configure `rsconnect` with token in RStudio.
4.  Publish the app from RStudio.
