# About this Workshop {.unnumbered}

The Shiny R package is now ten years old and is a popular tool to create immersive, web-based content. Although many coastal scientists have experience with R, expertise in dashboards is uncommon. This workshop will include a mix of instructor-led demonstrations, discussion, and exercises that will empower attendees to create their own Shiny applications. We will begin by showing what’s possible with the Quarto publishing system and Shiny by demoing existing applications from the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network ([MarineBON.org](https://marineBON.org)) and the National Estuary Program ([epa.gov/NEP](https://www.epa.gov/nep)). We will then transition to instructional material on the fundamentals of reactive programming with Shiny. Recent additions and improvements to Shiny (e.g., drag and drop user interface development, Python integration) will also be demonstrated. The remainder of the workshop will involve hands-on exercises that will allow attendees to develop their own applications using data from the examples above. 

Anyone interested in learning how to expand existing R skills for dashboard development will benefit from this workshop. This includes student, early career, and advanced professionals from any employment sector and field of expertise.

## Setup {.unnumbered}

Please visit the [setup](setup.qmd) page for instructions on preparing for this workshop.  You will be required to install R, RStudio, and Quarto prior to the workshop. You will also need to setup a GitHub and shinyapps.io account. 

We also expect some prior experience using R.  Please visit the [intro to R](rintro.qmd) page for a quick crash course.

Enrique Montes is a biological oceanographer working at the U. Miami Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) and NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) studying responses of marine life to changes in atmospheric and oceanographic conditions.  His research integrates environmental, bio-optical, genomic, and taxonomic measurements collected from ships with satellite data to resolve the oceanographic context of local observations, and characterize regional biogeographic conditions and ocean habitats.  He is a Co-Investigator of the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) in the USA and internationally. Montes is the Principal Investigator of the MBON Pole-to-Pole of the Americas, presides the International Association for Biological Oceanography (IABO), and serves as Executive Committee member of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR).
