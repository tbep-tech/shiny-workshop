## RStudio

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/){target="_blank"} is the go-to Interactive Development Environment (IDE) for R. Rstudio includes many features to improve the user's experience.

Let's get familiar with RStudio.

### Open R and RStudio

Find the RStudio shortcut on your computer and fire it up. You should see something like this:

![](figs/rintro/rstudio.png)

There are four panes in RStudio:

-   **Source**: Your primary window for writing code to send to the console, this is where you write and save R "scripts"
-   **Console**: This is where code is executed in R
-   **Environment, History, etc.**: A tabbed window showing your working environment, code execution history, and other useful things
-   **Files, plots, etc.**: A tabbed window showing a file explorer, a plot window, list of installed packages, help files, and viewer

### Scripting

In most cases, you will not enter and execute code directly in the console. Code can be written in a script and then sent directly to the console.

Open a new script from the File menu...

### Executing code in RStudio

After you write code in an R script, it can be sent to the Console to run the code. There are two ways to do this. First, you can hit the `Run` button at the top right of the scripting window. Second, you can use `ctrl+enter` (`cmd+enter` on a Mac). Either option will run the line(s) of script that are selected.

## R language fundamentals

R is built around functions. The basic syntax of a function follows the form: `function_name(arg1, arg2, ...)`.

With the base install, you will gain access to many functions (`r pkgs <- search(); pkgs <- pkgs[grep("package:",pkgs)]; length(unlist(sapply(pkgs,lsf.str)))`, to be exact). Some examples:

```{r}
# print
print("hello world!")
# sequence
seq(1, 10)
# random numbers
rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 2)
# average 
mean(rnorm(100))
# sum
sum(rnorm(100))
```

Very often you will see functions used like this:

```{r}
my_random_sum <- sum(rnorm(100))
```

The first part of the line is the name of an object that you make up. The second bit, `<-`, is the assignment operator. This tells R to take the result of `sum(rnorm(100))` and store it in an object named, `my_random_sum`. It is stored in the environment and can be used by just executing it's name in the console.

```{r}
my_random_sum
```

### What is the environment?

There are two outcomes when you run code. First, the code will simply print output directly in the console. Second, there is no output because you have stored it as a variable using `<-`. Output that is stored is saved in the `environment`. The environment is the collection of named objects that are stored in memory for your current R session.

## Packages

The base installation of R is quite powerful. Packages allow you to include new methods for use in R.

### CRAN

Many packages are available on CRAN, [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](http://cran.r-project.org/){target="_blank"}. This is where you download R and also where most will gain access to packages. As of `r format(Sys.time(), "%Y-%m-%d")`, there are `r nrow(available.packages())` packages on CRAN!

### Installing packages

When a package gets installed, that means the source code is downloaded and put into your library. A default library location is set for you.

We use the `install.packages()` function to download and install a package. Here, we install the readxl package, used below, which is used to upload data from and Excel file.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("readxl")
```

You should see some text in the R console showing progress of the installation and a prompt after installation is done.

After installation, you can load a package using the `library()` function. This makes all functions in a package available for you to use.

```{r}
library(readxl)
```

An important aspect of packages is that you only need to download them once, but every time you start RStudio you need to load them with the `library()` function.

## Data structures in R

Now we can talk about R data structures. Simply put, a data structure is a way for programming languages to handle information storage.

### Vectors (one-dimensional data)

The basic data format in R is a vector - a one-dimensional grouping of elements that have the same type. These are all vectors and they are created with the `c` (concatenate) function:

```{r}
dbl_var <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)
int_var <- c(1L, 6L, 10L)
log_var <- c(TRUE, FALSE, T, F)
chr_var <- c("a", "b", "c")
```

The four types of vectors are `double` (or numeric), `integer`, `logical`, and `character`. The following functions can return useful information about the vectors:

```{r}
class(dbl_var)
length(log_var)
```

### Data frames (two-dimensional data)

A collection of vectors represented as one data object are often described as two-dimensional data, like a spreadsheet, or in R speak, a data frame. Here's a simple example:

```{r}
ltrs <- c("a", "b", "c")
nums <- c(1, 2, 3)
logs <- c(T, F, T)
mydf <- data.frame(ltrs, nums, logs)
mydf
```

The only constraints required to make a data frame are:

1.  Each column (vector) contains the same type of data

2.  The number of observations in each column is equal.

## Getting your data into R

It is the rare case when you manually enter your data in R. Most data analysis workflows typically begin with importing a dataset from an external source. We'll be using `read_excel()` function from the readxl package.

We can import the `ExampleSites.xlsx` dataset as follows. Note the use of a *relative* file path. You can see what R is using as your "working directory" using the `getwd()` function.

```{r}
sitdat <- read_excel("data/ExampleSites.xlsx")
```

Let's explore the dataset a bit.

```{r}
# get the dimensions
dim(sitdat)
# get the column names
names(sitdat)
# see the first six rows
head(sitdat)
# get the overall structure
str(sitdat)
```

You can also view a dataset in a spreadsheet style using the `View()` function:

```{r}
#| eval: false
View(sitdat)
```

## Summary

In this intro we learned about R and Rstudio, some of the basic syntax and data structures in R, and how to import files.  You'll be able to follow the rest of the workshop with this knowledge.
