Although many coastal scientists have experience with R, expertise in dashboards is uncommon. This workshop will include a mix of instructor-led demonstrations, discussion, and exercises that will empower attendees to create their own Shiny applications. We will begin by showing what’s possible with the Quarto publishing system and Shiny by demoing existing applications from the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MarineBON.org) and the National Estuary Program (epa.gov/NEP). We will then transition to instructional material on the fundamentals of reactive programming with Shiny. Recent additions and improvements to Shiny (e.g., drag and drop user interface development, Python integration) will also be demonstrated. The remainder of the workshop will involve hands-on exercises that will allow attendees to develop their own applications using data from the examples above.\nAnyone interested in learning how to expand existing R skills for dashboard development will benefit from this workshop. This includes student, early career, and advanced professionals from any employment sector and field of expertise.\nAlso see:"

    "text": "2.2 Quarto overview\nQuarto is a relatively new document preparation system that lets you create reproducible and dynamic content that is easily shared with others. Quarto is integrated with RStudio and allows you to combine plain text language with analysis code in the same document.\nQuarto belongs to a class of literate programming tools called dynamic documents (Knuth 1984). It is not the first of its kind, but it builds substantially on its predecessors by bridging multiple programming langues.\nAdvantages of creating analyses using Quarto include:\n\nClear demonstration of a workflow using plain text and code\nReproducible materials allow others to use your work\nEasily shared content (e.g., on GitHub)\nKeeping the data, analysis, and writing all in the same place\n\nThis next section will run through the very basics of creating a Quarto document, some of the options for formatting, and how to generate shared content. You’ll follow along in this module.\n\nCreate a new project in RStudio, first open RStudio and select “New project” from the File menu at the top.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen select “New Directory”. Create a directory in a location that’s easy to find.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen a new Quarto file from the File menu under New file &gt; Quarto Document.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter a title for the document (e.g., “Quarto practice”) and your name as the author. Use the defaults for the other options and hit “Create”.\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the file in the project root directory (give it any name you want).\nLet’s get familiar with the components of a Quarto document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe three main components of a Quarto document are:\n\nYAML\nCode chunks\nPlain or Markdown text\n\n\n\nThe new file includes some template material showing the main components of a Quarto document. The content at the top is called YAML, which defines global options for the document.\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto practice\"\nauthor: \"Marcus Beck\"\neditor: visual\n---\nYou’ll also notice that there’s a button on the top-left that lets you toggle between “source” or “visual” editor mode. The source editor simply lets you add text to the document, whereas the visual editor lets you add content that is partially rendered. First time Quarto users may prefer the visual editor.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the visual editor, we can insert a code chunk (or code cell). This can be done by selecting the appropriate option from the Insert menu. Note the variety of programming langues that can be used with the code chunk.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can enter any code we want in the code chunks, including options for how the code chunk is evaluated. Options are specified using the hashpipe notation, #|.\n```{r}\n#| echo: true\nprint('Hello Quarto!')\n```\nWhen the file is rendered, the code is run and results displayed in the output. There are many options to change how code chunks are executed, which we’ll discuss below.\n\nprint('Hello Quarto!')\n\n[1] \"Hello Quarto!\"\n\n\nWe can also run the code chunks separately without rendering the file using the arrow buttons on the top right in the source document. This can be useful for quickly evaluating your code as you include it in the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCode chunks are executed in the order they appear in the document when a .qmd file is rendered.\n\n\nDescriptive text can be entered anywhere else in the file. This is where we can describe in plain language what our analysis does or any other relevant information. Text can be entered as-is or using simple markdown text that can format the appearance of the output. If you’re using the visual editor, you can use some of the items in the file menu to modify the text appearance. In the source editor, you can manually enter markdown text:\n\n\nI  can write anything I want right here. Here's some **bold text**.\n\nI can also make lists\n\n1. Item 1\n1. Item 2\n\n\n\nWhen the file is rendered, the markdown text will be formatted. The text will already be formatted if you’re using the visual editor:\n\nI can write anything I want right here. Here’s some bold text.\nI can also make lists\n\nItem 1\nItem 2\n\n\nRender the .qmd file to the output format.\nThe source file is a .qmd document. We need to render the document to create the output format - HTML (default), PDF, or Word. The following happens when you hit the render button at the top.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what your RStudio session should look like (note the three parts of the source .qmd document - YAML, code chunk, and Markdown text). The rendered HTML file will appear in the Viewer pane on the right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA rendered Quarto document as an HTML, PDF, Word, or other file format is stand-alone and can be shared with anybody!"

This can be useful for a few reasons.\n\nOnly displaying the output of a code chunk\nOnly displaying the code and not running the chunk\nRunning the code without displaying output for use in other parts of the document\nSuppressing warnings and messages\nDefining table or figure options (e.g., height, width, captions, etc.)\n\nCode chunk options can be applied globally to all chunks in the document or separately for each chunk.\nTo apply them globally, they’ll look something like this in the YAML, where options are added after execute:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\n\nexecute: \n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBe careful with indentation in the YAML, the document won’t render if the indentation is incorrect.\n\n\nTo apply to individual code chunks, use the #| (hashpipe) notation at the top of the code chunk. This will override any global options if you’ve included them in the top YAML. Below, echo: true indicates that the code will be displayed in the rendered output.\n```{r}\n#| echo: true\nplot(1:10)\n```\nHere’s a short list of other useful execution options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\neval\nEvaluate the code chunk (if false, just echos the code into the output).\n\n\necho\nInclude the source code in output\n\n\noutput\nInclude the results of executing the code in the output (true, false, or asis to indicate that the output is raw markdown and should not have any of Quarto’s standard enclosing markdown).\n\n\nwarning\nInclude warnings in the output.\n\n\nerror\nInclude errors in the output (note that this implies that errors executing code will not halt processing of the document).\n\n\ninclude\nCatch all for preventing any output (code or results) from being included (e.g. include: false suppresses all output from the code block).\n\n\nmessage\nInclude messages in rendered output\n\n\n\nR code can also be executed “inline” outside of code chunks. This can be useful if you want to include statements that reference particular values or information that is linked directly to data. Inline R code is entered using the r syntax.\n\n\nI can enter inline text like `r 1 + 1`.\n\n\n\nText with inline R code will look like this when the document is rendered.\n\nI can enter inline text like 2."

There are several packages that use htmlwidgets to embed the required JavaScript visualization libraries. This does not require any knowledge of JavaScript, nor use of a Shiny Server.\n\n2.5.1 leaflet\nThe leaflet package can be used to create interactive maps (also see mapview) for an “out-of-the-box” option).

An HTML file can easily be shared by email, although it must be created as a “standalone” file for others to use. You’ll notice that sometimes external files or subfolders are created when you use any of the above options to add dynamic content. This is fine if you are working locally, but to share with others, you can create a standalone HTML file by adding the following option in the YAML:\nformat:\n  html:\n    embed-resources: true"

This approach is useful to make the document available to anyone with the web address.\nThe easiest way to do this is to publish your document to RPubs, a free service from Posit for sharing web documents. Click the  publish button on the top-right of the editor toolbar. You will be prompted to create an account if you don’t have one already.\nThis can also be done using the quarto R package in the console.\nquarto::quarto_publish_doc(\n  \"data/quartoex.qmd\", \n  server = \"rpubs.com\"\n  )\nYou can also use the Quarto CLI in the terminal. Here we are publishing the document to Quarto Pub.\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto publish quarto-pub data/quartoex.qmd\n\nIf your Quarto document is in an RStudio project on GitHub, you can also publish to GitHub Pages.\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto publish gh-pages data/quartoex.qmd"

    "text": "3.2 Create your first Shiny web app\nSimilar to other examples, let’s create a simple Shiny app starting from the provided default by going to File -&gt; New File -&gt; Shiny Web App… and name it app-faithful (after faithful, the Old Faithful geyser eruption frequency dataset used in this default example):\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now, let’s go with the default Single File option that puts the entire application in app.R rather than splitting it in two (ui.R/server.R). You should see the following contents in the new app.R file contents:\n#\n# This is a Shiny web application. You can run the application by clicking\n# the 'Run App' button above.\n#\n# Find out more about building applications with Shiny here:\n#\n#    http://shiny.rstudio.com/\n#\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\n# Define UI for application that draws a histogram\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n\n    # Application title\n    titlePanel(\"Old Faithful Geyser Data\"),\n\n    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins \n    sidebarLayout(\n        sidebarPanel(\n            sliderInput(\"bins\",\n                        \"Number of bins:\",\n                        min = 1,\n                        max = 50,\n                        value = 30)\n        ),\n\n        # Show a plot of the generated distribution\n        mainPanel(\n           plotOutput(\"distPlot\")\n        )\n    )\n)\n\n# Define server logic required to draw a histogram\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n\n    output$distPlot &lt;- renderPlot({\n        # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R\n        x    &lt;- faithful[, 2]\n        bins &lt;- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)\n\n        # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins\n        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')\n    })\n}\n\n# Run the application \nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\nLet’s next Run App. Note that you can change the options by clicking on the down triangle next to the button, such as running the app in your default web browser (Run External), a pop-up window or in RStudio’s Viewer Pane.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can change the values in the slider on the left, then see the plot updated:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Shiny parlance, the histogram plot is reactive to the slider. Normally when creating web apps, this type of “reactivity” is quite complicated to code, but here by simply using input$bins in the plotting function for the output$distPlot, Shiny registers that this plot needs to be updated when the user changes the input$bins value.\n\n3.2.1 Run in showcase mode\nThis default example along with other are made available in the shiny package’s installed folder:\n\n# get path to \"examples\" under your installation of the Shiny R package\ndir_examples  &lt;- system.file(\"examples\", package=\"shiny\")\n\n# get all directories listed there\ndirs_examples &lt;- list.dirs(dir_examples, recursive = F)\n\n# show the folder name only, not the rest of the path preceding (ie dirname())\nbasename(dirs_examples)\n\n [1] \"01_hello\"      \"02_text\"       \"03_reactivity\" \"04_mpg\"       \n [5] \"05_sliders\"    \"06_tabsets\"    \"07_widgets\"    \"08_html\"      \n [9] \"09_upload\"     \"10_download\"   \"11_timer\"     \n\n\nAnother way to launch the shiny app is with the following:\n\n# set directory to 01_hello app, aka the simplest default faithful app\ndir_hello_app &lt;- file.path(dir_examples, \"01_hello\")\n\n# run the app with display.mode = \"auto\"\n#   which under shiny R package uses \"showcase\" mode because of the DESCRIPTION  file there (see ?shiny::runApp)\nshiny::runApp(dir_hello_app)"

In contrast, Github and most web hosting services can not host a Shiny app. Although the leaflet and plotly visualizations in this document are interactive in the web browser, they do not require the Shiny library or a Shiny server to be displayed. Rather, the HTML output can be easily hosted on the most basic web server or passed as an email attachment.

RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you install RStudio.\nThanks to the USGS-R Training group and Data Carpentry for making their installation materials available. The following instructions come directly from their materials, with a few minor edits to help you get set up.\n\nA.1.1 Windows: Download and install R\nGo to CRAN and download the R installer for Windows. Make sure to choose the latest stable version (v4.2.3 as of April 2023).\nOnce the installer downloads, Right-click on it and select “Run as administrator”.\nType in your credentials and click yes (or if you don’t have administrator access have your IT rep install with Admin privileges).\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can click next through the standard dialogs and accept most defaults. But at the destination screen, please verify that it is installing it to C:\\Program Files\\R\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the “Select Components” screen, you can accept the default and install both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this screen, uncheck ‘Create a desktop icon’ because non-admin users in Windows will be unable to delete it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.1.2 Windows: Download and install RStudio\nDownload RStudio from here.\nAfter download, double-click the installer. It will ask for your administrator credentials to install (you might need to have your IT rep install again).\nAccept all the default options for the RStudio install.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.1.3 macOS: Download and install R\n\nDownload and install R from the CRAN website for Mac here.\nSelect the .pkg file for the latest R version\nDouble click on the downloaded file to install R\nIt is also a good idea to install XQuartz (needed by some packages)\n\n\n\nA.1.4 macOS: Download and install RStudio\n\nGo to the RStudio download page\nUnder Installers select the appropriate RStudio download file for macOS\nDouble click the file to install RStudio\n\n\n\nA.1.5 Check Install\nOnce installed, RStudio should be accessible from the start menu. Start up RStudio. Once running it should look something like this:"

First, install the usethis R package in RStudio.\n\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\n\nYou must let Git know who you are and that you have permission to write to a GitHub repository. First, let Git know who you are, where you enter your user name and email associated with the account from the previous step.\n\nusethis::use_git_config(user.name=\"Jane Doe\", user.email=\"jane@example.org\")\n\nNext, you need to setup a personal access token (PAT) that defines the permissions to write to a repository. This can be done as follows:\n\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\nThen follow the remaining prompts to complete the PAT creation. A more thorough explanation can be found here."

Specifically, we’ve indicated that we’d like a table of contents (toc: true) and that the sections should be numbered (number-sections: true) in the rendered documents.\nWe’ve also added some specific options to the HTML and PDF output. For the HTML output, we’ve indicated that we want the code chunks to be folded (i.e., toggle between seen and not seen, code-fold: true). For the PDF output, we’ve changed the geometry of the margins using the geometry options.\nHere’s what the HTML output would look like:\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many other options available for each output format, as well as other format types.

    "text": "C.2 Citations and References\nOne of the more valuable aspects of Quarto is the ability to easily add and reference other works in your document. This includes finding papers and reports, citing them in your document, and formatting references - all with relative ease in Quarto.\nYou can of course do this using the source editor, but it’s slightly easier using the visual editor. If we switch to visual mode (top-left button of the .qmd file), you can type a forward-slash to view a menu of items to insert in the document. Just start typing text to search items to insert.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe Insert Anything tool in the visual editor is useful to… insert anything! Just execute / at the beginning of a line or Ctrl/Cmd + / after some text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also insert a citation from the menu at the top of the .qmd file.\n\n\n\n\n\nEither option will open the citation menu where you can add citations from a variety of sources (ie., Zotero, DOI, CrossRef, PubMed, or DataCite).\nFor example, we can copy/paste a DOI to find a reference of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\nOr we can search by title.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the paper is found, you can click the Insert button to add it to your document. This adds a reference file, information in the YAML, and the in-text citation. The reference file will be called references.bib by default and includes a BibTeX formatted reference that looks like this:\n@article{shafland1982,\n    title = {Lower lethal temperatures for fourteen non-native fishes in Florida},\n    author = {Shafland, Paul L. and Pestrak, James M.},\n    year = {1982},\n    month = {03},\n    date = {1982-03},\n    journal = {Environmental Biology of Fishes},\n    pages = {149--156},\n    volume = {7},\n    number = {2},\n    doi = {10.1007/bf00001785},\n    url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00001785},\n    langid = {en}\n}\nThe YAML file will now indicate the reference file to use that includes the references (bibliography: references.bib).\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto practice\"\nauthor: \"Marcus Beck\"\neditor: visual\nbibliography: references.bib\ntoc: true \nnumber-sections: true\nformat: \n  html: \n    code-fold: true\n  docx: default\n  pdf: \n    geometry: \n      - top=30mm\n      - left=0mm\n---\nThe text citation will look like this, where @ is the tag used to reference the citation using the identifier from the references file.\nMany non-native species in Florida have lower lethal temperatures [@shafland1982].\nWhen the Quarto file is rendered, the citation will be formatted and you’ll see it added to the references section at the end of the document.\n\nMany non-native species in Florida have lower lethal temperatures (shafland1982?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe @ citation syntax also has different options for displaying the citation in the text (full explanation here). For example, omitting the brackets does the following:\n@shafland1982 state that many non-native species in Florida have lower lethal temperatures.\n\n(shafland1982?) state that many non-native species in Florida have lower lethal temperatures.\n\nAdditional information about citations in Quarto can be found here."
