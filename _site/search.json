    "text": "About this Workshop\nThe Shiny R package is now ten years old and is a popular tool to create immersive, web-based content. Although many coastal scientists have experience with R, expertise in dashboards is uncommon. This workshop will include a mix of instructor-led demonstrations, discussion, and exercises that will empower attendees to create their own Shiny applications. We will begin by showing what’s possible with the Quarto publishing system and Shiny by demoing existing applications from the Marine Biological Observation Network and the National Estuary Program. We will then transition to instructional material on the fundamentals of reactive programming with Shiny. Recent additions and improvements to Shiny (e.g., drag and drop user interface development, Python integration) will also be demonstrated. The remainder of the workshop will involve hands-on exercises that will allow attendees to develop their own applications using data from the examples above.\nAnyone interested in learning how to expand existing R skills for dashboard development will benefit from this workshop. This includes student, early career, and advanced professionals from any employment sector and field of expertise."

    "text": "2.2 Create your first Shiny web app\nSimilar to other examples, let’s create a simple Shiny app starting from the provided default by going to File -> New File -> Shiny Web App… and name it app-faithful (after faithful, the Old Faithful geyser eruption frequency dataset used in this default example):\n\nFor now, let’s go with the default Single File option that puts the entire application in app.R rather than splitting it in two (ui.R/server.R). You should see the following contents in the new app.R file contents:\n#\n# This is a Shiny web application. You can run the application by clicking\n# the 'Run App' button above.\n#\n# Find out more about building applications with Shiny here:\n#\n#    http://shiny.rstudio.com/\n#\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\n# Define UI for application that draws a histogram\nui <- fluidPage(\n\n    # Application title\n    titlePanel(\"Old Faithful Geyser Data\"),\n\n    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins \n    sidebarLayout(\n        sidebarPanel(\n            sliderInput(\"bins\",\n                        \"Number of bins:\",\n                        min = 1,\n                        max = 50,\n                        value = 30)\n        ),\n\n        # Show a plot of the generated distribution\n        mainPanel(\n           plotOutput(\"distPlot\")\n        )\n    )\n)\n\n# Define server logic required to draw a histogram\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n\n    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({\n        # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R\n        x    <- faithful[, 2]\n        bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)\n\n        # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins\n        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')\n    })\n}\n\n# Run the application \nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\nLet’s next Run App. Note that you can change the options by clicking on the down triangle next to the button, such as running the app in your default web browser (Run External), a pop-up window or in RStudio’s Viewer Pane.\n\nNow you can change the values in the slider on the left, then see the plot updated:\n\nIn Shiny parlance, the histogram plot is reactive to the slider. Normally when creating web apps, this type of “reactivity” is quite complicated to code, but here by simply using input$bins in the plotting function for the output$distPlot, Shiny registers that this plot needs to be updated when the user changes the input$bins value.\n\n2.2.1 Run in showcase mode\nThis default example along with other are made available in the shiny package’s installed folder:\n\n# get path to \"examples\" under your installation of the Shiny R package\ndir_examples  <- system.file(\"examples\", package=\"shiny\")\n\n# get all directories listed there\ndirs_examples <- list.dirs(dir_examples, recursive = F)\n\n# show the folder name only, not the rest of the path preceding (ie dirname())\nbasename(dirs_examples)\n\n [1] \"01_hello\"      \"02_text\"       \"03_reactivity\" \"04_mpg\"       \n [5] \"05_sliders\"    \"06_tabsets\"    \"07_widgets\"    \"08_html\"      \n [9] \"09_upload\"     \"10_download\"   \"11_timer\"     \n\n\nAnother way to launch the shiny app is with the following:\n\n# set directory to 01_hello app, aka the simplest default faithful app\ndir_hello_app <- file.path(dir_examples, \"01_hello\")\n\n# run the app with display.mode = \"auto\"\n#   which under shiny R package uses \"showcase\" mode because of the DESCRIPTION  file there (see ?shiny::runApp)\nshiny::runApp(dir_hello_app)"

In contrast, Github and most web hosting services can not host a Shiny app. Although the leaflet and plotly visualizations in this document are interactive in the web browser, they do not require the Shiny library or a Shiny server to be displayed. Rather, the HTML output can be easily hosted on the most basic web server or passed as an email attachment. The Shiny context allows for ultimate flexibility with user interactions, but may be overkill for basic visualization.
